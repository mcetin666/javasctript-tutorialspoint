it covers most og the impotant consepts related to javascript such as 
*operators, 
*control flow, 
*functions, 
*objects, 
*oops, 
*asynchronous javascript,
*events 
*dom manipılation and much more
JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language
It is a dynamically typed programming language, which means that we don’t care about variable data types while writing the JavaScript code.
JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language that we can use for client-side or server-side development.
You can use the <script > tag to add JavaScript in the HTML file. However, it also allows you to add JavaScript to the web page from the external JavaScript file, having '.js' extension.
Dom Manipulation
JavaScript allows developers to manipulate the webpage elements. Also, you can control the browser.
Event Handling
JavaScript allows you to handle the events used to interact with the web page.
Dynamic Typing
JavaScript decides the type of variables at runtime. So, we don’t need to care about variable data type while writing the code, providing more flexibility to write code.
Functional Programming
JavaScript supports the functional programming. In JavaScript, you can define the first-class function, pure functions, closures, higher-order functions, arrow funcitons, function expresions, etc.
Object-oriented Programming
JavaScript contains the classes, and we can implement all object-oriented programming concepts using its functionality.
It also supports inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism, encapsulation, etc, concepts of Object-oriented programming.
Built-in Objects
JavaScript contains built-in objects like Math and Date. We can use a Math object to perform mathematical operations and a Date object to manipulate the date easily.
Object Prototypes
In JavaScript, everything is an object. For example, array, function, number, string, boolean, set, map, etc. are objects.
Built-in Methods
JavaScript also contains the built-in methods for each object. Developers can use the built-in methods to write efficient and shorter codes.
Modular Programming
JavaScript allows you to write the code in different modules and connect them with the parent module. So developers can write maintainable code.
JSON
JSON stands for JavaScript object notation. It is a widely used data format to exchange data between two networks. For example, server and client.
Asynchronous Programming
JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language. To execute your code faster, you can use asynchronous programming.
Event-driven Architecture
The event-driven architecture of JavaScript allows developers to create interactive and responsive web applications by handling a large user base concurrently.
Server-side Support
The Node.js runtime environment of JavaScript is widely used to create the backend of the application, as javaScript can also be used to create servers. It allows you to create a scalable backend for the application
JavaScript Syntax
JavaScript syntax comprises a set of rules that define how to construct a JavaScript code. JavaScript can be implemented using JavaScript statements that are placed within the <script>... </script> HTML tags in a web page.
You can place the <script> tags, containing your JavaScript, anywhere within your web page, but it is normally recommended that you should keep it within the <head> tags.
